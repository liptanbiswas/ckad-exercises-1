some remarks to this exercise. These issues might be bugs, they are confusing at the least.
- The '--record' option was available for 'kubectl create' in a previous version but seems now gone. In case you want the whole history in the annotations I only found the 'kubectl apply' to be functional.
- The annotations seem to get overwritten if you use a 'set image' command.
